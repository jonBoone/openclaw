# src/AGENTS.md

Telegraph style. Source code rules for `src/`, `ui/`, `packages/`, and `apps/`.

## Architecture

- Core stays plugin-agnostic. No bundled ids/defaults/policy in core when manifest/registry/capability contracts work.
- Plugins cross into core only via `openclaw/plugin-sdk/*`, manifest metadata, injected runtime helpers, documented barrels (`api.ts`, `runtime-api.ts`).
- Plugin prod code: no core `src/**`, `src/plugin-sdk-internal/**`, other plugin `src/**`, or relative outside package.
- Core/tests: no deep plugin internals (`extensions/*/src/**`, `onboard.js`). Use public barrels, SDK facade, generic contracts.
- Owner boundary: owner-specific repair/detection/onboarding/auth/defaults/provider behavior lives in owner plugin. Shared/core gets generic seams only.
- Dependency ownership follows runtime ownership: plugin-only deps stay plugin-local; root deps only for core imports or intentionally internalized bundled plugin runtime.
- Internal bundled plugins ship in core dist; bundled-only facade loader ok only for them.
- External official plugins own package/deps and are excluded from core dist; core uses registry-aware `facade-runtime` or generic contracts.
- Externalizing a bundled plugin: update package excludes, official catalogs, docs, tests, and prove core runtime paths resolve installed plugin roots before root-dep removal.
- Runtime reads canonical config only. No silent compat for old/malformed config keys. If a config change invalidates existing files, add a matching `openclaw doctor --fix` migration. Core/auth config repairs live in core doctor; plugin-owned config repairs live in that plugin's doctor contract (`legacyConfigRules` / `normalizeCompatibilityConfig`).
- OpenAI Codex is folded into `openai`. No new/live `openai-codex` provider/plugin/auth/model routes; treat them as legacy input only. Runtime/setup/auth/catalog use `openai` + `openai/*`; doctor/migrations repair stale `openai-codex/*` profiles/metadata.
- Config/env surface bar is high; `openclaw.json` and environment variables are already large. Before adding a config option or env var, first prove existing product behavior, provider selection, defaults, or doctor migration cannot solve it. Prefer removing or consolidating config/env options when touching these surfaces.
- CLI setup flows are public API when external docs, installers, or integrations can copy them. Changes to `openclaw onboard`, `openclaw configure`, their documented flags, non-interactive behavior, or generated config shape are compatibility-sensitive API contract changes; prefer additive flags/aliases, deprecation windows, and backward-preserving migrations over breaking existing snippets.
- New binary fallible-operation results use `Result` from `@openclaw/normalization-core/result`; domain-rich outcomes keep named discriminated unions.
- Compatibility is opt-in. "Shipped" means reachable from a release Git tag; main/GitHub/PR/unreleased code is not shipped.
- Refactor default: one canonical path. Delete the old path unless user explicitly wants compat or the shipped public contract is obvious and cited.
- Reuse the canonical non-array record guard instead of adding local `isRecord` copies. Core, UI, scripts with workspace package resolution, and packages that already depend on normalization-core import `@openclaw/normalization-core/record-coerce`; plugins import `openclaw/plugin-sdk/string-coerce-runtime`. Keep a local guard only when the semantics intentionally differ or the file must remain dependency-free, browser-serialized, generated, or runnable outside workspace package resolution.
- Core runtime consumes only current canonical shapes/config/data. Legacy or retired shapes normalize only in doctor/migration code before runtime; no runtime shims, aliases, or fallback readers.
- State/storage migrations are database-first. Runtime reads/writes the canonical store only. Old file stores, sidecars, aliases, and fallback readers belong in `openclaw doctor --fix` migration code only, never steady-state runtime.
- Storage default: SQLite only. Do not add JSON/JSONL/TXT/sidecar files for OpenClaw-owned runtime state, caches, queues, registries, indexes, cursors, checkpoints, or plugin scratch data.
- Any SQLite change requiring a schema-version bump needs explicit user discussion and acceptance before implementation. Agents must not advance SQLite schema versions autonomously.
- Purely additive SQLite surface (new tables; downgraded builds keep working, just without the new feature): do not bump the schema version. Declare in the canonical schema file plus a one-time idempotent lazy ensure on first feature use; fold into the migration path at the next natural bump. Bumps are reserved for changes older readers cannot tolerate.
- SQLite runtime access uses Kysely helpers, not raw SQL statement strings, except schema DDL, migrations, low-level DB bootstrap, or narrowly justified SQLite primitives.
- SQLite write transactions are synchronous commit sections only. Finish async planning, filesystem access, plugin hooks, and predicates before `BEGIN`; then reread and validate authoritative rows before writing. Never return a Promise or execute `await` from a transaction callback.
- Use the shared state DB (`state/openclaw.sqlite`) for global runtime state and plugin KV data. Use the per-agent DB (`agents/<agentId>/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite`) for agent-scoped state/cache. Use a dedicated SQLite DB only when schema, volume, or lifecycle clearly does not fit those stores.
- Legacy state/cache files are migration debt. When touching code that reads/writes them, prefer moving the data into SQLite or calling out the refactor follow-up; do not add parallel file paths.
- File storage must be a named product artifact: import/export, user attachment, log, backup, or external tool contract. If it is app state or cache, it belongs in SQLite.
- Before adding any path under state dirs, choose one: shared state DB, plugin KV, agent DB, or dedicated SQLite schema. If none fits, design the SQLite owner/schema first.
- Cache/transient state gets no compat migration unless a shipped user contract is cited. Prefer delete/drop/rebuild over import. If old state can be lost without user-visible data loss, remove the old path entirely.
- Persistent user state gets one migration owner. Doctor migrates, verifies, and then runtime assumes the new shape. No dual-write, read-through fallback, lazy import, or "if SQLite fails use JSON" branches.
- Fallback is a product decision, not an implementation convenience. Before adding one, name the shipped contract, failure mode, removal plan, and why doctor cannot solve it. Otherwise delete it.
- Keep old behavior only for an explicit public API/config/plugin SDK/data contract, tagged upgrade path, security/migration boundary, dependency contract, or observed prod state.
- If unsure, ask before preserving compat. Do not keep aliases, shims, fallback stacks, stale names, or obsolete tests just in case.
- Tests alone do not make internals contracts. If compat stays, name the contract and migration/removal plan in code, test, or PR.
- Plugin SDK exception: shipped external API gets new API first plus named compat/deprecation, small tests/docs if useful, removal plan.
- Migrate internal/bundled callers to modern API in the same change. Do not let internal compat become permanent architecture.
- Channels are implementation under `src/channels/**`; plugin authors get SDK seams. Providers own auth/catalog/runtime hooks; core owns generic loop.
- Message/channel plugins stay transport-only. They render portable presentation/actions, enforce transport limits, and map native callback envelopes. They do not own product command trees, plugin/provider policy, or feature-specific menus.
- Portable command UI must use typed presentation actions, not raw string inference. Do not make channels guess that `value` starting with `/` means a native command; core/owner plugins declare command actions, channels map them when supported.
- Raw callback data is transport/private. Approval, command, URL, web-app, and select actions must stay distinguishable before channel encoding so transport adapters do not special-case product strings.
- Agent run terminal state: normalize/merge via `src/agents/agent-run-terminal-outcome.ts`; do not rederive timeout/cancel precedence in projections.
- Hot paths should carry prepared facts forward: provider id, model ref, channel id, target, capability family, attachment class. Do not rediscover with broad plugin/provider/channel/capability loaders.
- Do not fix repeated request-time discovery with scattered caches. Move the canonical fact earlier; reuse prepared runtime objects; delete duplicate lookup branches.
- Gateway/plugin metadata is process-stable: installs, manifests, catalogs, generated paths, bundled metadata. Changes require restart or explicit owner reload/install/doctor flow.
- Runtime hot paths: no freshness polling (`stat`/`realpath`/JSON reread/hash). Reuse current snapshots, install records, discovery, lookup tables, root scopes, resolved paths.
- Process-local metadata caches ok when lifecycle-owned and bounded/single-slot. Freshness exceptions need named owner + tests.
- Gateway protocol changes: additive first; incompatible needs versioning/docs/client follow-through.
- Protocol version bumps: explicit owner confirmation only; never automatic/generated.
- Config contract: exported types, schema/help, metadata, baselines, docs aligned. Retired public keys stay retired; compat in raw migration/doctor only.
- Prompt cache: deterministic ordering for maps/sets/registries/plugin lists/files/network results before model/tool payloads. Preserve old transcript bytes when possible.
- Model-context budget: every injected prompt/tool-schema/context item is bounded with a hard cap; no unbounded items. New model-visible text that can cross ~1K tokens is a P0 review flag needing explicit justification. Context builds incrementally; only compaction rewrites history.
- Tool/prompt descriptions never statically name tools from other toolsets/plugins; gating turns the reference into hallucination bait. Needed cross-references are injected at definition-build time from what is actually available. Descriptions state capability, not implementation; no marketing words.
- Guidance the model must apply in full (skills, playbooks, prompt instructions) is served whole: no offset/limit or windowed-read parameters on those tools. Given a window, the model treats the first window as the whole document.
- Prompt-state mutations (skills/tools/memory) default to deferred cache invalidation — effect next session; immediate invalidation is an explicit opt-in.
- Agent tool schema cleanup: remove stale args cleanly; no hidden compat for model-facing params just to avoid churn.

## Code

- TS ESM, strict. Avoid `any`; prefer real types, `unknown`, narrow adapters.
- No `@ts-nocheck`. Lint suppressions only intentional + explained.
- External boundaries: prefer `zod` or existing schema helpers.
- Runtime branching: discriminated unions/closed codes over freeform strings. Avoid semantic sentinels (`?? 0`, empty object/string).
- Cross-function state: when valid combos matter, return a closed mode/result shape. Avoid parallel nullable fields or derived booleans that callers must keep in sync; make impossible states unrepresentable.
- Formatter-friendly shape: when oxfmt explodes an expression vertically, extract named booleans, payloads, or small helpers. Do not change width or use format-ignore for local compactness.
- Calls should be boring: complex decisions happen above; call args/object fields are names, literals, or simple property reads.
- Prefer early returns over nested condition pyramids. Split code into gather -> normalize -> decide -> act.
- Use named intermediates only for domain meaning or readability; avoid temp-variable soup.
- Correct but not over-engineered. Correctness on real inputs/states is mandatory; extra layers, guards, and generality for imagined ones are defects, not rigor.
- Codebase is already large; pragmatism wins. Extremely unlikely edge cases are tradable for real simplification — name the accepted tradeoff (comment or PR) so it is a decision, not an oversight.
- Production LOC is a first-class constraint; count tests separately. Prefer net-neutral or net-negative production changes. Positive production LOC requires a concrete capability, ownership boundary, security invariant, or public/dependency contract that cannot be expressed more simply.
- Prefer deleting branches, modes, adapters, and tests over preserving them. A refactor that adds a second path has probably failed unless the old path is a cited shipped contract.
- New helpers/files must pay rent immediately: fewer call paths, fewer concepts, or less repeated logic. No helpers for one-off compat, naming translation, or speculative resilience.
- Before adding helpers/files, check whether existing code can absorb the behavior with less new surface.
- Keep APIs narrow: export only current caller needs; keep types/helpers local by default.
- Return the smallest useful shape. Avoid broad result objects, flags, metadata unless callers use them.
- Avoid adapter layers that only rename fields. Move real responsibility or leave code local.
- Inline simple one-use objects/spreads when clearer. Extract only when it removes duplication or hard logic.
- Classes: no prototype mixins/mutations. Prefer inheritance/composition. Tests prefer per-instance stubs.
- Split files around ~700 LOC when clarity/testability improves.
- Never add a `max-lines` suppression. Existing suppressions are grandfathered TODOs; split the file and remove its suppression plus baseline entry.
- Naming: **OpenClaw** product/docs; `openclaw` CLI/package/path/config.
- Agents navigate by grep: exported symbols use 2-3 word unique names; no generic single-word exports (`get`, `run`, `create`, `handle`).
- New modules/dirs concept-named; no new `utils/`, `helpers/`, `common/`. One spelling per concept repo-wide.
- English: American spelling.

## Plugin SDK

- SDK surface gate: `pnpm plugin-sdk:surface:check`; no `plugin-sdk:surface-report` script.
- SDK exports: `src/plugin-sdk/api.ts`, `src/plugin-sdk/runtime-api.ts`, `src/plugin-sdk/string-coerce-runtime.ts`, `src/plugin-sdk/result.ts`.
- SDK is the only boundary plugins use. Internal core code may bypass SDK for performance; plugins may not.
